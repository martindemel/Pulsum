TASK: Fix SplineRuntime package resolution error

ISSUE: The GitHub package reference "https://github.com/spline-design/Spline-iOS" doesn't exist (404 error), causing package resolution failures.

SOLUTION: Remove the broken GitHub package reference from Xcode project and use cloud URL only with gradient fallback.

SPLINE CONFIGURATION:
- Cloud URL: https://build.spline.design/ke82QL0jX3kJzGuGErDD/scene.splineswift (WORKS - verified accessible)
- This URL serves the .splineswift scene file directly
- SplineRuntime framework will be added manually later

IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Remove SplineRuntime GitHub package from Pulsum.xcodeproj:
   - Edit Pulsum.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj
   - Find and remove XCRemoteSwiftPackageReference "Spline-iOS" section
   - Remove SplineRuntime from packageReferences array
   - Remove SplineRuntime product dependencies from all targets

2. Keep the existing PulsumRootView implementation as-is:
   - AnimatedSplineBackgroundView already has #if canImport(SplineRuntime) guards
   - Already has fallbackGradient for when SplineRuntime unavailable
   - Already has cloudURL configured correctly
   - Code structure is perfect - don't change it!

3. Update Package.swift if SplineRuntime was referenced there:
   - Remove any SplineRuntime dependencies

4. Build verification:
   - swift build --package-path Packages/PulsumUI (should succeed)
   - All local packages should resolve (PulsumAgents, PulsumML, PulsumServices, PulsumData, PulsumUI)

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR AFTER FIX:
- App builds successfully ✅
- PulsumRootView shows beautiful gradient background (since SplineRuntime framework not available yet)
- All UI functionality works (navigation, journal, sliders, recommendations, chat)
- When SplineRuntime.xcframework is added manually later, the #if canImport check will activate and load the cloud Spline scene

GRADIENT FALLBACK COLORS (already in code):
- Deep blue-purple gradient from (0.09, 0.1, 0.19) to (0.18, 0.12, 0.35)
- Looks professional and matches app theme

DO NOT:
- Don't try to add SplineRuntime from other sources
- Don't modify the AnimatedSplineBackgroundView implementation (it's already correct)
- Don't remove the cloud URL (we'll use it when framework is available)

VERIFY:
After making changes, confirm:
1. swift build succeeds for all packages
2. No package resolution errors
3. App can be built in Xcode

NOTE FOR LATER:
SplineRuntime.xcframework will be added manually from official Spline distribution. The code is already structured to activate automatically when the framework becomes available (via #if canImport check).
