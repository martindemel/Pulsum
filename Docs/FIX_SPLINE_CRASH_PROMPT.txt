URGENT: Fix SplineRuntime crash - app is crashing on launch due to missing SplineRuntime framework

ISSUE: App crashes with objc_release error because SplineRuntime is imported but framework not available

IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED:

1. Remove SplineRuntime GitHub package from Xcode project:
   - Open Pulsum.xcodeproj in Xcode
   - Select project (blue icon)
   - Go to "Package Dependencies" tab
   - Find "Spline-iOS" package
   - Click "-" button to remove it
   - Confirm deletion

2. Verify PulsumRootView.swift has proper fallback (should already be there):
   File: Packages/PulsumUI/Sources/PulsumUI/PulsumRootView.swift
   
   The AnimatedSplineBackgroundView should use:
   ```swift
   @ViewBuilder
   private var splineScene: some View {
       #if canImport(SplineRuntime)
       if let url = cloudURL ?? localURL {
           SplineView(sceneFileURL: url)
       } else {
           fallbackGradient
       }
       #else
       fallbackGradient  // ← This will be used since SplineRuntime not available
       #endif
   }
   
   private var fallbackGradient: some View {
       LinearGradient(
           colors: [
               Color(red: 0.09, green: 0.1, blue: 0.19), 
               Color(red: 0.18, green: 0.12, blue: 0.35)
           ],
           startPoint: .topLeading,
           endPoint: .bottomTrailing
       )
   }
   ```

3. Clean and rebuild:
   - Product → Clean Build Folder (⇧⌘K)
   - Product → Build (⌘B)
   - Product → Run (⌘R)

EXPECTED RESULT:
- App launches successfully ✅
- Shows beautiful purple-blue gradient background (not 3D scene)
- All UI features work (Pulse button, Settings, navigation)
- No crashes ✅

VERIFICATION:
- Launch app - should see gradient background
- Tap Pulse button - should open PulseView sheet
- Tap Avatar - should open SettingsView
- Switch to Coach tab - should show CoachView
- All features functional

NOTES:
- SplineRuntime will be added later when we have proper framework
- Gradient looks professional and matches design
- Cloud URL is saved in code for future use
- This unblocks Milestone 4 testing and Milestone 5 work

CRITICAL: Do not try to add SplineRuntime from any package manager - it's not available via SPM anymore. Remove it completely for now.
