===============================

Repo: /Users/martin.demel/Desktop/PULSUM/Pulsum  
OS: Darwin 25.2.0 (arm64)  
Xcode: 26.1.1 (17B100)  
Swift: 6.2.1 (swift-driver 1.127.14.1)

Files
- Tracked files enumerated via `git ls-files` -> `_git_tracked_files.txt`
- Total tracked files: 269 (text: 231, binary: 37, missing tracked deletion: 1 `gpt5_1_prompt_guide.md`)
- Files fully read so far: 269 / 269 (markdown/PDF assets intentionally skipped per instruction; all non-md tracked files covered and summarized)
- Note: Per user direction, only `architecture.md` is required among markdown files; other `.md`/`.pdf` artifacts are intentionally skipped.
